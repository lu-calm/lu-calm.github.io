Aave is a Decentralised finance application that finds optimum interest rates for
Ethereum based Assets from a number of providers and methods across the
Ethereum Blockchain.

The aim of this section is to remove the assets I have stored with Aave and return
them to the Wallet and DApp Gateway.

Within this section of the document we will cover the following topics.

-= Connect to Aave =-
-= Withdraw Assets from Deposit =-
-= Select Market =-

These may be referenced in other sections from other services in this document.
These topics may not be conducted in order and may need to be conducted multiple times
throughout this document.

= Connect to Aave =-

In your internet browser search/ address bar type: "app.aave.com"

Press Enter to access the website.

An element will be on the screen asking to "Select your Market".

Click the "X" in the top corner.

Click Wallet icon in the top left of the page and select "Connect your Wallet".

In the options select the Wallet identified in the Wallet and DApp Gateway section of
this document. If you are unable to find your specific wallet, select "Browser Wallet".

A new screen will pop-up asking for login-in details for your Wallet and DApp Gateway.

Log-in to you Wallet and DApp in the pop-up screen with your Wallet and DApp
Gateway password.

Select account with my Ethereum Address.

Click Connect.

If successful, if you click on the Wallet icon on the top right of the Aave page
the "Connect your Wallet" button will be replaced with my Ethereum Address.

-= Withdraw Assets from Deposit =-

This section will outline how to withdraw a selection of assets back to your my wallet.

In your internet browser search/ address bar type: "app.aave.com/deposit"

Press Enter to access the website.

This "Deposit" will display all the different types of Ethereum based Assets that
can be deposited on Aave to earn interest on them.

The Assets I have invested with Aave can be identified within the "Assets" section of
the page with a button labelled "Withdraw".

The process for removal is the same for each Asset in Aave, please follow the below
steps for each Asset listed with the "Withdraw" button.

Click "Withdraw".

Select "100%".

Click "Withdraw".

A new pop-up will be on the screen with the title "Confirm Transaction".

You need to Confirm the transaction with the Wallet and DApp Gateway. As the Wallet
and DApp Gateway was connected previously another pop-up of the Wallet and
DApp Gateway will appear on the screen.

Click Confirm on the new Wallet and DApp Gateway pop-up.

The Transaction will be submitted to withdraw the Asset and it now needs to be
approved by the Ethereum Blockchain. Approval can take seconds, minutes, hours or days
depending on how many Transactions globally are awaiting approval.

The  Wallet and Dapp Gateway will give confirmation when the Transaction has
been approved.

If the Transaction is rejected try the above steps again.

Once approved the Asset will now have been successfully transferred to the
connected Wallet and DApp Gateway.

Repeat this process for the remaining Assets in the "Assets" section.

Within Aave there are different Markets that are available. My Assets could be stored
in more than one of these markets.

By default, Aave is set to the Aave market.

The market can be changed by clicking the button below the "Change Market" text at
the bottom right of the webpage.

Go through each of the markets available,checking the Deposit page this is accessed
via "app.aave.com/deposit" as shown in the -= Withdraw Assets from Deposit =- section.

If the "Withdraw" button is visible for any of the assets. Follow the same process for
removing the Assets as shown in the -= Withdraw Assets from Deposit =- section.

This is the end of the Aave section.
