Loopring is a Decentralised Exchange that uses an alternative method for making
Transactions. In order to make Transactions on the Loopring exchange, Assets need to
be deposited with the application.

The aim of this section is to remove the assets I have stored with Loopring and return
them to the Wallet and DApp Gateway.

Within this section of the document we will cover the following topics.

-= Connect to Loopring =-
-= Withdraw Assets from Loopring =-

These may be referenced in other sections from other services in this document.
These topics may not be conducted in order and may need to be conducted multiple times
throughout this document.

This section will outline how to withdraw a selection of assets back to your my wallet.

Click "Account" at the top of the web-page.

At the bottom of the page there will be a table of all Assets that can be
traded on Loopring.

In the top header of the table click "Available". This will organise the Assets I
have stored within Loopring with the highest amount to zero.

Each of the Assets listed with a non-zero value in the "Available" column will need to
be withdrawn.

Follow the below process for each Asset with a non-zero balance.

Choose an Asset to withdraw with a non-zero balance.

Click the associated "Withdraw" button on the right of the table.

At the bottom of the newly loaded element is the amount of the chosen Asset
is "Available to Withdraw".

Type the amount identified as "Available to Withdraw" in the "Amount" text input field.

A new pop-up will be on the screen with the title "Confirm Transaction".

You need to Confirm the transaction with the Wallet and DApp Gateway. As the Wallet
and DApp Gateway was connected previously another pop-up of the Wallet and DApp Gateway
will appear on the screen.

Click Confirm on the new Wallet and DApp Gateway pop-up.

The Transaction will be submitted to withdraw the Asset and it now needs to be
approved by the Ethereum Blockchain. Approval can take seconds, minutes, hours or days
depending on how many Transactions globally are awaiting approval.

The  Wallet and Dapp Gateway will give confirmation when the Transaction has
been approved.

If the Transaction is rejected try the above steps again.

Once approved the Asset will now have been successfully transferred to the connected
Wallet and DApp Gateway.

Repeat this process for the remaining Assets that have non-zero balance in
the "Available" column of the Asset table.

This is the end of the Loopring section.
